## Prompt

/sp.constitution based on the plan discussed make constitution

User context: Creating the constitution for the 5-Phase Evolution of Todo hackathon project. The hackathon requires:
- Spec-Driven Development with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus
- No manual code writing - all code generated from specs
- 5 phases: Console App → Web App → AI Chatbot → Minikube → Cloud Deployment
- AI integration with OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP SDK, and ChatKit
- Cloud-native deployment with Kubernetes, Helm, Kafka, and Dapr

## Response snapshot

Created constitution v1.0.0 with 6 core principles:

1. **Spec-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: All implementation must follow specify → plan → tasks → implement workflow
2. **No Manual Code (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: All code generated by Claude Code from specifications
3. **Test-First Development**: Red-Green-Refactor cycle mandatory, 80% coverage target
4. **Progressive Phase Evolution**: 5 phases building upon each other (Console → Web → AI → K8s → Cloud)
5. **AI-Native Architecture**: OpenAI Agents SDK + MCP SDK + ChatKit for conversational interface
6. **Cloud-Native Readiness**: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Dapr, Kafka for production deployment

Also included:
- Technology Stack Constraints by phase
- Monorepo structure definition
- Development workflow with quality gates
- PHR requirements
- Governance and versioning policy

## Outcome

- Impact: Established foundational governance document for entire hackathon project
- Tests: N/A (constitution is documentation)
- Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md created
- Next prompts: /sp.specify for Phase I Console App, AGENTS.md creation
- Reflection: Successfully derived 6 principles from hackathon requirements covering all phases

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Manual review - PASS (all placeholders filled, principles are testable)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A - initial creation
